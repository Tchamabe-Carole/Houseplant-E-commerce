3. **Cart Slice** (`cartSlice.js`):
   - Manages the shopping cart state with reducers for:
     - Adding items to cart
     - Increasing item quantity
     - Decreasing item quantity
     - Removing items from cart
     - Automatically calculating total quantity and amount

## Responsive Design

- Responsive text and image sizes

## User Experience

The user journey follows a logical flow:
1. Land on the attractive landing page with company information
2. Click "Get Started" to browse products
3. Add products to cart with visual feedback
